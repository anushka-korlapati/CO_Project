# Assembly Language Simulator

This project is a simple assembly language simulator that includes an assembler, a floating-point conversion module, and a simulator for a custom assembly language. The assembly language supports various instructions, registers, variables, and labels.

## Assembler (assembler.py)

The assembler reads assembly code written in a custom language and produces machine code for simulation. It performs syntax checks, register validation, and handles variables and labels. The output machine code is then used by the simulator.


## Floating-Point Conversion (floating_point.py)

This module provides functions for converting floating-point numbers between binary and decimal representations. It is utilized by the assembler to handle floating-point instructions seamlessly.


## Simulator (simulator.py)

The simulator executes machine code generated by the assembler. It emulates a CPU with a register file and memory. The execution of each instruction is printed, providing a clear understanding of the program flow.



## Example

There are test cases attached to check the functioning.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

## Error Handling

The assembler includes a comprehensive error-handling system, providing detailed messages about any encountered issues during the assembly process. Check the error codes and descriptions in the code for troubleshooting.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
